// Vertex shader. What does that mean?
// A vertex shader is responsible for processing each vertex's attributes,
// such as position and color, and passing data to the fragment shader.

layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPosition; // Input vertex position. Meaning, this is the position of the vertex in 3D space.
layout (location = 1) in vec3 aColor; // Input vertex color. This is the color of the vertex.
// layout = Specifies the location of the input attribute in the shader.
// In this case, aPosition is at location 0 and aColor is at location 1.

// These matrices are created in C++ and uploaded to the GPU as uniforms.
// A uniform keeps the same value for every vertex processed by this draw call.
uniform mat4 model;
uniform mat4 view;
uniform mat4 projection;

out vec3 vertexColor; // Output variable to pass the vertex color to the fragment shader.
out vec2 localCoord; // Local/object-space XY coordinate for fragment shader experiments.

void main()
{
    // Start with the local/object-space vertex from the VBO. The final 1.0 makes
    // it a homogeneous position, so matrix translations affect it. Reading the
    // multiplication from right to left follows the vertex through these spaces:
    // local -> world (model) -> view (view) -> clip (projection).
    gl_Position = projection * view * model * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);

    // Which matrix would you change to move the object without moving the viewer?
    // Which one controls perspective and the visible clipping range?
    vertexColor = aColor;

    localCoord = aPosition.xy;
